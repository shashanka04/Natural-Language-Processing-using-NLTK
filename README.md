# Natural-Language-Processing-using-NLTK
Natural Language Processing (NLP):

Definition:

NLP is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the interaction between computers and human languages.
The goal is to enable computers to understand, interpret, and generate human-like text.

Tasks in NLP:

Tokenization:

Breaking down text into smaller units such as words or sentences.

Part-of-Speech Tagging:
Assigning grammatical categories (like noun, verb, adjective) to words.

Named Entity Recognition (NER):
Identifying and classifying entities in text, such as names of people, organizations, locations, etc.

Sentiment Analysis:
Determining the sentiment expressed in a piece of text (positive, negative, neutral).

Text Classification:
Categorizing text into predefined classes or categories.

*Challenges in NLP:*

Ambiguity:
Words or phrases can have multiple meanings depending on context.

Variability:
Language is diverse, and people express ideas in various ways.

Context Dependency:
Understanding meaning often requires considering the broader context.

Text Preprocessing Using NLTK:

>Tokenization:

Breaking down text into individual words or sentences.
Enables further analysis on a more granular level.

>Removing Stopwords:

Stopwords are common words (e.g., "the," "and") that don't carry significant meaning.
Removing them helps focus on more meaningful words.

>Stemming:

Reducing words to their root form by removing suffixes.
Helps in consolidating similar words.

>Lemmatization:

Similar to stemming but considers the context and reduces words to their base or dictionary form.
Provides more linguistically accurate results compared to stemming.

>Lowercasing:

Converting all text to lowercase.
Ensures consistency in word representation.
Removing Punctuation and Special Characters:

Eliminating non-alphabetic characters from the text.
Enhances the focus on words.

>Normalization:

Ensuring consistent representation of words, such as converting numbers to text or handling abbreviations.
Spell Checking and Correction:

Correcting typos and misspellings to improve overall text quality.

>Feature Engineering:

Creating new features or representations to enhance the performance of NLP models.
Examples include n-grams, word embeddings, and other advanced techniques.

>Putting It All Together:

The combination of these preprocessing steps depends on the specific NLP task and the characteristics of the text data.
Text preprocessing is crucial for effective NLP, as it helps create cleaner, more manageable data that facilitates accurate analysis and model training. The choice of preprocessing steps depends on the nature of the text and the goals of the NLP application.


**FEATURE EXTRACTION**

 Natural Language Processing (NLP), feature extraction involves converting raw text data into a format that can be used for machine learning models. The goal is to represent the text data in a way that captures relevant information for the task at hand. NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) is a popular library in Python for working with human language data.

Here's a brief overview of feature extraction in NLP using NLTK:

>Tokenization:

Tokenization is the process of breaking down a text into individual words or tokens.
NLTK provides tools for tokenization, allowing you to split text into words or sentences.

*CODE*
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize, sent_tokenize

text = "This is a sample sentence. Tokenize me!"
words = word_tokenize(text)
sentences = sent_tokenize(text)

print(words)
print(sentences)

>Stopword Removal:

Stopwords are common words (e.g., "the," "and," "is") that are often removed during feature extraction since they may not carry much information.
NLTK provides a list of stopwords that can be used for removal.

**CODE**

from nltk.corpus import stopwords

stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))
filtered_words = [word for word in words if word.lower() not in stop_words]

print(filtered_words)

>Stemming or Lemmatization:

Stemming and lemmatization are techniques to reduce words to their base or root form.
NLTK provides modules for both stemming and lemmatization.

**CODE**

from nltk.stem import PorterStemmer, WordNetLemmatizer

porter_stemmer = PorterStemmer()
lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()

stemmed_words = [porter_stemmer.stem(word) for word in words]
lemmatized_words = [lemmatizer.lemmatize(word) for word in words]

print(stemmed_words)
print(lemmatized_words)

>Feature Vectors:

Convert the preprocessed text into numerical feature vectors that can be used as input to machine learning models.
Techniques like bag-of-words or TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) can be employed for this purpose.

**CODE**

from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer, TfidfVectorizer

corpus = ["This is a sample sentence.", "Tokenize me!"]
vectorizer = CountVectorizer()
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(corpus)

print(X.toarray())


#These are some fundamental steps in feature extraction using NLTK for NLP. Depending on your specific task, you might need to explore other techniques and more advanced tools for feature representation.

**SENTIMENT ANALYSIS**

Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is a subfield of natural language processing (NLP) that focuses on determining the sentiment or emotional tone expressed in a piece of text. Sentiment analysis can be applied to various types of text data, such as customer reviews, social media posts, and news articles. NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) provides tools and resources to perform sentiment analysis in Python. Here's a more in-depth explanation of sentiment analysis using NLTK:

1. Text Preprocessing:
Before performing sentiment analysis, it's essential to preprocess the text data. This involves steps such as:

Tokenization: Breaking the text into individual words or tokens.
Removing stop words: Common words that may not carry much sentiment.
Stemming or lemmatization: Reducing words to their base or root form.

**CODE**

from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from nltk.stem import PorterStemmer

def preprocess_text(text):
    # Tokenization
    words = word_tokenize(text)
    
    # Remove stop words
    stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))
    filtered_words = [word for word in words if word.lower() not in stop_words]
    
    # Stemming
    porter_stemmer = PorterStemmer()
    stemmed_words = [porter_stemmer.stem(word) for word in filtered_words]
    
    return stemmed_words

2. Sentiment Lexicons:
NLTK includes sentiment lexicons that associate words with their sentiment polarity (positive, negative, or neutral). The AFINN lexicon is one such resource.

**CODE**

from nltk.sentiment import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer

sid = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()

def get_sentiment(text):
    # Sentiment analysis using the Sentiment Intensity Analyzer
    sentiment_scores = sid.polarity_scores(text)
    
    if sentiment_scores['compound'] >= 0.05:
        return 'Positive'
    elif sentiment_scores['compound'] <= -0.05:
        return 'Negative'
    else:
        return 'Neutral'

The SentimentIntensityAnalyzer assigns a compound score, which combines the positive, negative, and neutral scores. Based on the compound score, a sentiment label (Positive, Negative, or Neutral) can be assigned.

3. Machine Learning Approach:
NLTK can also be used to implement a machine learning approach to sentiment analysis. This involves training a classifier on a labeled dataset and using it to predict sentiment in new text.

**CODE**

from nltk.classify import NaiveBayesClassifier
from nltk.classify.util import accuracy

def extract_features(document):
    words = set(document)
    features = {}
    for word in word_features:
        features[word] = (word in words)
    return features

# Assuming you have a labeled dataset

training_data = [(preprocess_text(text), label) for (text, label) in labeled_data]
word_features = list(set([word for (text, label) in training_data for word in text]))

# Extract features and train the Naive Bayes classifier

training_features = [(extract_features(text), label) for (text, label) in training_data]
classifier = NaiveBayesClassifier.train(training_features)

# Test the classifier

test_data = "This is a positive review."
test_features = extract_features(preprocess_text(test_data))
sentiment = classifier.classify(test_features)
In this example, NaiveBayesClassifier is used, but other classifiers can be employed based on your specific requirements.

4. Evaluation:
It's crucial to evaluate the performance of your sentiment analysis model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

**CODE**

# Assuming you have a test set
test_features = [(extract_features(text), label) for (text, label) in test_data]
accuracy_score = accuracy(classifier, test_features)
This allows you to assess how well your model generalizes to new, unseen data.

These are the key steps involved in sentiment analysis using NLTK. Depending on the complexity of your task, you may need to explore more advanced techniques and consider the nature of your text data.
